# Calculator Demo for Mobile Visual Testing Tutorial

## Overview

This project is a simple HTML5 app which demonstrates how Functional testing alone is not enough for a proper quality control.

In this demo, we first look at Figure 1, where we can see a standard layout calculator

Figure 1, Normal Layout Calculator (aka, v1)

Then, we observe Figure 2 with a completely re-arranged layout of the calculator. The focus is on the fact that this v2 calculator functionally behaves correctly (i.e. caclutions are correct), but visually it drastically differs from what a user tend to expect (i.e. differ visually from v1 calculator).
